  <p>Hi everyone and welcome on my website, I'm glad to see you here. My name is Hugo Gybels, I am 21 and I am studying computer science in an Engineering  school. On this website you will find some information about me, who I am, what I like and what I do. You will also find some projects I've been working on with all codes and overviews of what I did. You will also find a contact form that you should not hesitate to use. As a first step in this website I invite to visit my 'presentation' which simply is a quick overview of who I am. You will find a resume of my studies and work experience and some of my personal interests. If you are not interested, you can also scroll to the next section, projects, but if you want to know more about me, visit this section: 'Presentation'.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Projects</h3>
  <p>As far as I can remember, I've always liked to create things. That's surely a reason why I like development, but also electronic and even handiwork. I also like the idea of sharing work, that's why you can find all of my source code from each of my project, event this website if you are interested in web development. You will find some of my projects and work experience and simple funny pages or Arduino/raspberry DIY. Most of the time you will find the corresponding code on GitHub repositories. There are some projects you can interact which like <q>'logos'</q> in witch you can give me your favorit logo and you can even try to create and send me one. I like creating stuff and I hope you will like discovering those. If there is any project that you would like to learn more about do not hesitate to contact me. I hope this projects will give you some inspiration for everything you are doing. Take some time to discover my projects !</p>
