<h1>Osisoft Iternship</h1>

<p>
   I did my 10 weeks internship in Germany (Frankfurt) in the company OSISoft. I was hired in the development team. I was working on their PI System.
</p>
<p>
  My project was about the communication between an ODBC client, a "translating server", and a SQL server. To accomplish this connection, I had to configure a double-hop scenario which was using GSS-api from Kerberos MIT release for authentication. Indeed, the translating server is using the client credentials to connect to the SQL server so a delegation needed to be configured. This configuration was already done but their observed a delay of 10 seconds for every connection on windows clients that they didn't have on linux clients. My project was to fix this delay.
</p>

  You can here find an overview of each of my weeks during this internship such as my repport resuming my work on this project.
