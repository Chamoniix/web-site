<h1 id="osisoft-internship-week-2">OSISoft Internship - Week 2</h1>
<p>Here is a quick summary of my second week.</p>
<h2 id="where-i-was">Where I was</h2>
<p>I started the installation of my 5 machines, but I still had a lot to learn about the PI system and some work for having the entire chain working.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-did">What I did</h2>
<p>During this week I installed all the virtual machines that I needed. I had several issues during this installation and had to ask some help to my colleagues from the tech support and the IT department. Finally everything was working except the trust connection for Kerberos witch seemed to have configuration issues.</p>
<p>I also attend a meeting with workers from Mexico, Madrid, Paris, Brazil, San Leonardo and other for the deployment of a new tool witch was very interesting.</p>
<p>Finally on Friday my tutor came back and I started to move to the development team.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-have-to-do">What I have to do</h2>
<p>Now that I have good basics and knowledge about the PI system and a local sample of it, I can start my project witch will be creating an application using GSS-API and Kerberos connection.</p></body>
