<h1 id="osisoft-internship-week-3">OSISoft Internship - Week 3</h1>
<p>Here is a quick summary of my third week.</p>
<h2 id="where-i-was">Where I was</h2>
<p>At the end of the previous week, I had learned a lot about the Pi System and how it works <em>(specially the double-hop senario using kerberos)</em> and what is composing it. I had my small &quot;local lab&quot;
with the simplest Pi System. But I still didn&#39;t know anything about the real development that I was about to begin.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-did">What I did</h2>
<p>That&#39;s why I had a lot of things to do this week :</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first was to <strong>install my environment</strong> in the development team <em>(transfer of VM and installing IDE)</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Then I tried to understand excatcly what will I have to do during this project. It turns out finally that I will have to develop a totally independent application using the same technologies as
the ODBC client and the DAS server : <strong>windows sockets</strong> for the connection, <strong>Kerberos</strong>, <strong>GSS-API</strong> and maybe <strong>SSPI</strong> for authentication.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From here I tried to compile a lot of sample projects. The first difficulty I had was <strong>finding the good libraries and importing those in my projects</strong>. I finally succeed to be able to use all the gss functions and variables. Nevertheless, every projects samples that I could found were either for windows platform or out-of-date <em>(functions using OLD C instead of ANSI C declaration witch aren&#39;t compatible with Visual 2017 and other)</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I then used the samples to understand how the sequence of execution was executed by the different samples, witch were, in my opinion, too complicated for the basic connection,to then <strong>create my very own project</strong>. I specially used this <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/816-1331/">course</a> witch contains a course about GSS-API, ans sample project and a complete walk-through of this example; this <a href="https://github.com/BeyondTrust/pbis-open">git</a> in witch I found some windows samples and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com">Microsoft website</a> for diplaying errors. For now I did :</p>
<ul>
<li>The client importing name of the server</li>
<li>The client connection</li>
<li>The client asking for security context</li>
<li>The server connection via windows sockets</li>
<li>The server acquire is own internal name</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-i-have-to-do">What I have to do</h2>
<p>At the end of the week I was stuck on the server side on the function <strong>gss_acquire_credentials</strong>. So I will try next week to resolve the credentials acquiring ans the to <strong>accept the security context</strong>.</p></body>
