<h1 id="osisoft-internship-week-1">OSISoft Internship - Week 1</h1>
<p>Here is a quick summary of my fisrt week.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-did">What I did</h2>
<p>My first day at OSISoft was Monday the 13th of June. On the first day I met my tutor who helped me installing my computer in the tech support office. He also gave me several sources of documentation that I had to use to discover the PI system and what exactly the company is doing. I met everybody from different teams and then started <strong>watching learning videos, reading courses, newsletters, documentations and overview of each components</strong>.</p>
<p>Then I started the <strong>installation</strong> that I had to do before the development team comes back <em>(at the end of next week)</em>. This installation consisted in a &quot;local lab&quot; composed of 5 machines representing a PI system. Those machines are :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain controller</strong> : <em>windows server</em>, how handle the domain, computers, users, dhcp, etc.</li>
<li><strong>PI Server</strong> : <em>windows server</em>, store archives and communicates with machines via the interfaces. Data witch is stored in it isn&#39;t really friendly user but is efficiently stored especially with time management.</li>
<li><strong>AF server</strong> : <em>windows server</em>, Stores cached data from previous queries, sql server, and allow an easy communication with users. It is the link between machines data and human data.</li>
<li><strong>Data Access Server</strong> : <em>windows 10</em>, Translate ODCB or JDCB language into sql queries or other language for the AF server or PI server. Middleware for ODBC and SQL.</li>
<li><strong>ODBC Client</strong> : <em>windows 10</em>, Client using ODBC driver to send queries through this entire system.</li>
</ul>
<p>During this first week I installed the Domain controller and PI server using video tutorials of the company and the live documentations.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-have-to-do">What I have to do</h2>
<p>During next week I will have to install the 3 other virtual machines. I will also try to learn more about Kerberos&#39;s role.</p></body>
